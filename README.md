# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

**Shalini Saree** is a modern **e-commerce platform** built using **React** ⚛️ for the frontend and **Node.js with Express** 🖥️ for the backend. It offers a seamless and intuitive **online saree shopping experience** 🛍️. The platform is designed with **both user and admin functionalities**, making it a **fully functional** and **scalable** solution for managing an online saree store.  

## 🌟 **Key Features**  

### 🔹 **User Side:**  
- **Responsive and Intuitive UI** 📱💻 for a smooth shopping experience.  
- **Product Browsing & Details View** 🔍 with high-quality images.  
- **Add to Cart & Checkout System** 🛒 for easy order placement.

- **Product Management** 🏪 (Add ➕, Update 📝, Delete ❌).  
- **Order Management** 📦 for processing and tracking.

- **Database:** MongoDB 🗄️ for efficient data storage  
- **Authentication:** JWT 🔑 for secure login  
- **Deployment:** Netlify 🌍 (Frontend), Cloud Server ☁️ (Backend)  

## 🚀 **Deployment & Security**  
The frontend is hosted on **Netlify** for **fast performance** ⚡, while the backend runs on a **secure cloud-based environment**. **CORS policies** 🔗 are correctly configured for seamless frontend-backend communication.
